 One particular book which is <u>recommended reading is</u> The Street Lawyer by John Grisham. <b>This book is
about a lawyer</b> who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law
firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes the harsh existence
of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <i>The Street Lawyer is a great book.</i> It is
well written and interesting. Other books by John Grisham include The Firm, The Pelican Brief, and The
Client.
